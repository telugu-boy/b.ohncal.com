Fun fact: Telugu people are the only group I know that, upon meeting a fellow Telugu outside of India, will converse in **English** instead of their own mother tongue.

<hr>

Telugu culture has been laid-back. We have not been progressive in any part of our society and still retain a backwards colonial mentality of racism and casteism. We would ignore the greatest dark-skinned man, but would be enthralled by an evil light-skinned man. Our first thought upon meeting a fellow Telugu, is to find out his gotra and caste. It is the NRI Telugu's highest dream that his child speaks English in a White accent - something that he can never achieve, and something that he feels inferior for.


We have no pride in our own language, because we pride in replacing మేలిమి (pure) Telugu words with Sanskrit words (Vijayanagaram), Persian/Urdu words (Nizams and Nawabs), and now the latest trend, replacing pure Telugu words with English words at nearly light speed. We claim that Telugu is a sweet language or the Italian of the East; that Telugu is of centuries past, and today is only found in remote villages. The average Telugu will _mock_ and laugh at you when you speak the true Telugu, as you are now a rustic and backwards villager in their warped eyes. With this mockery and incessant, almost obsessive tendency to import loanwords from "superior" languages, it has been indoctrinated into Telugu people, us, that our language is nothing but an inferior toy language: the skeleton is of Tamil and meat is that of Sanskrit, Persian and English. The disturbing aspect in this, is that we take pride in this corrupted and harsh creole, which is void of any proclaimed sweetness - we fool ourselves into thinking that it makes us "modern", "successful" or "forward" for having egregious levels of foreign influence in our language.


It is not that simple to become "forward" in any meaningful sense. There is no effortless way out of this [*tragically slavish mentality*](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Telugu-people-ridicule-and-discourage-a-fellow-Telugu-person-who-speaks-pure-Telugu-and-not-the-everyday-Telugu-which-is-contaminated-by-a-lot-of-English-words/answer/Subrahmanyam-Marripoodi) that shackles our development as a society. We **ARE NOT** developed by obsessing over English or other "superior" languages as a status symbol, trying to assimilate into the perceivedly "superior" Western culture, then criticizing our own "lesser" Telugu language as rustic; we are merely exacerbating our inferiority complex from colonial India. We **ARE** developed only with great cultural pride and unity. Discarding the fanatical and obsolete importance we place on caste and skin colour, Telugus will have an incentive to gain influence in their own right - rather than chasing status (America, Canada, UK, Australia, White accents) or money (NRI, doctor, software developer or engineer) for our entire lives to compensate for our inferiority complex, we will approach life holistically, recognizing that money and status do not dictate if we are failures or winners.


We are Telugus first, then everything else - not vice-versa. How can we regain appreciation for our identity? The rough path out of this *slavish mentality* has indeed been trodden before: look at Bengalis, Tamils, Marathis, Gujaratis and other influential groups. They have something in common, and it is something that we skipped - revolution.


Bengalis had an upheaval of culture. From language, poetry to abolishing the social evils like Sati and Untouchability. Similar things were done by Marathis. They also have a legacy of promoting a backward class as the ruler class in their recent history, a cause of heavy social upward mobility, and thus establishing an empire. Tamils went from being heavily hierarchical to bringing focus on the lower classes. They even abolished caste names and surnames, and instead switched it with their fathers' names throughout the whole state.


Malayalis dominated the initial days of independent India by being an efficient and easily employed workforce, just like the Tamils, going to farther places unreachable from their homeland, such as the Gulf and Southeast Asia. They did not have a feeling of "inferiority" for working in such positions like us. Gujaratis are entrepreneurs; even if they are in a foreign land with quite a bare investment, they put the maximum amount of effort to grow their business.


What does this have to do with fame and recognition? Well, for starters, we are still the same as our 19th century people. Money, cities, and jobs have changed but the people, their outdated beliefs, and their archaic mentality staunchly prevails, pervades, and permeates our society. Nobody wants to take the risk of a great leap to go somewhere unknown, to do something uncommon or to set up something unique.


We don't even appreciate our literary outputs of the 20th century; what do you expect in fame to our artists, writers, poets or any literary or historical figures? We don't even try to go against our parents or neighbours, so what do we expect to serve to society? We don't even try to go get a job that pushes us out of our comfort zone, and instead would settle for a job in the software industry or government services, the latter like 1980s India. We disregard anything which does not help us reach our goal of stable money. We do not even try to advance our career once we have a job! What more can you expect to innovate or implement? Anyone who studies anything apart from medicine or engineering is destined to be a loser in our eyes, and does not deserve encouragement.


With this closed-minded and regressive psychology, what else would you expect apart from software developers, engineers, and doctors who would only do the service they are trained to do? We boast that Telugus are everywhere across the globe, but are we doing anything differently in any of these foreign countries? No - same old, apathetic, unambitious, unconducive and stagnant mentality. When we move abroad, we are still middle-class software developers, engineers, and doctors. It is extremely rare to find a Telugu who breaks this mold. We sing boundless praise about our Telugu or Indian CEOs, but have you wondered why we are never the founders of such companies? It is obvious: would you expect Telugus to contribute *anything* novel to society with this mentality?


Is it "modern" and "successful" to lack originality, to possess limited creativity and minimal awareness of our own society, with no individual excellence in art, sports, fitness, culture, nor even a fluent command in our own mother tongue, as we misappropriate English into every sentence we speak? Does that make us successful, worldly, or superior to our fellow Telugus? Does it place us above other Telugus? One is not made **స్వతంత్రుడు (आज़ादी/FREE)** by being a **బానిస (गुलाम/SLAVE)** to society's institutions, especially not institutions that systemically dismantle our innate creativeness and originality as,humans, and effectively turns us into slaves. At least a slave is versatile enough to do any task, but we are only fit to do the task that we are assigned by our "superiors" - White people who speak with a White accent. That task is all which a "modern" Telugu knows in life: working in a templated white-collar job, stuck in the middle class with no greater aspiration than to teach his children the same thing. In that aspect, a manual labourer is freer than the "modern" Telugu.


This is not to undermine anyone who is striving hard to bring a great name to our Telugu society. This is to say that we are sticking to encouraging one small margin of people who ably try to glorify us (actors, politicians, directors), and we get upset when the output of famous individuals turns out to be in numbers countable on our fingers.


Of course, people will say that "others are exceeding us," but are we actually racing to even compare ourselves with them? We have shown no signs of leaving our 19th century colonial mentality, obsessed with caste and status, which is what Britishers used to destabilize and disunify Indians. In reality, we are living in the 21st century with basically the same society as in the 19th. Only the strugglers make their names! And I'm proud that our neighbours are doing great in this factor, sticking to whatever makes them better every day. As proud Telugus, we must employ *inspiration* from our successful neighbours - not seek to imitate them, losing our own precious identity in the process. Thank you.


As a side note, I credit Ramoji for his efforts in preserving Telugu culture with ETV news, the last *real* Telugu news station.
