Fun fact: If two Tamils meet in any place outside of Tamil Nadu, they speak in Tamil. If two Malayalis meet outside of Kerala, they speak in Malayalam. If two Telugus meet outside of Andhra, guess what? They speak in English.

<hr>

Telugu culture has been laid-back. We have not been progressive in any part of our society and still retain a backwards colonial mentality of racism, casteism and superficiality. We would dismiss the greatest dark-skinned man as ugly, choosing an evil light-skinned man over him for a professional position. Our first thought upon meeting a fellow Telugu, is to find out his gotra and caste, while conversing in English or Telglish of course. It is the NRI Telugu's highest dream that his child speaks English in a White accent - something that he can never achieve, and something that he feels inferior for.


We have no pride in our own language, because we pride in replacing మేలిమి (pure) Telugu words with Sanskrit words, Persian/Urdu words, and now the latest trend, replacing all Telugu words with English words at nearly light speed. We claim that Telugu is a sweet language or the Italian of the East; this Telugu is of centuries past, and today is only found in remote villages. The average Telugu will _mock_ and laugh at you when you speak in the true Telugu, as you are now a rustic and backwards villager in their warped perception of society: as if speaking the true Telugu indubitably proves that you are uncultured or "stuck in the past"; ironic, because to coin new words, and to attempt in disseminating them is to be "stuck in the past" as well. So with the incessant, almost obsessive tendency to import loanwords from "superior" languages, outsiders are shocked: it is emblazoned into their mind that our language is nothing but an inferior toy language, whose skeleton is of Tamil and meat is that of Sanskrit, Persian and English. The disturbing aspect in this is that we take pride in this corrupted and harsh creole, which is void of any proclaimed sweetness - we fool ourselves into thinking that we are a "forward society" or "stylish" for having egregious levels of foreign influence on our language and our identity.


It is not that simple to become a "forward" society like this, in any meaningful sense. Even if all Telugus were to speak fluent English in a White accent, do you think casteism, racism and corruption would instantly be solved? No - there is little difference from that hypothetical society and British India. We would still be ignorant, casteist, and racist as we are today; spineless and servile to a superior race which promotes meaningless strife within our people. Our cities would not invite international business, because speaking English is common worldwide. Rather we would "flee" (I have seen Telugu NRIs who use this word, as if they were refugees escaping a warzone) to other Western countries to work, as we do today. In this hypothetical society, all that happens is the loss of our heritage and our rich culture that distinguishes us from the rest of the world. What is left for the average Telugu then, other than an backwards, identityless and artificial society?

There is no effortless way out of this [*slavish mentality*](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Telugu-people-ridicule-and-discourage-a-fellow-Telugu-person-who-speaks-pure-Telugu-and-not-the-everyday-Telugu-which-is-contaminated-by-a-lot-of-English-words/answer/Subrahmanyam-Marripoodi) that shackles our development as a people, economically and culturally. We **are not** considered developed by obsessing over English or German or other "superior" languages as a status symbol, trying to assimilate into the perceivedly "superior" Western culture, then criticizing our own "lesser" Telugu language as rustic; we are merely compensating for our inferiority complex from colonial India - money, social status and trendiness alone do not dictate if we are failures or winners, "modern" or "uncivilized". We **are** considered developing only with great cultural pride and unity, that we decide to show an iota of awareness of the condition of our pathetic society, and will to improve it. And we **are** truly developed when Telugu arts and original thinking experience a renaissance, when we have social mobility in the likes of the West, and when there is no caste-based or skin-colour-based discrimination, so that a Telugu's sole objective in his life would not be to leave his own soil and abandon his culture like a released criminal who takes a new name and moves far away.


Our current condition is quite puzzling to every other onlooking race on Earth. Quora writer మఱ్ఱిపూడి సుబ్రహ్మణ్యం (Marripudi Subrahmanyam) states it excellently: "Most Telugus try to cover up their inferiority complex and their utter lack of Telugu pride in something supposedly bigger - like being an Indian, an international citizen, cosmopolitan, humanist or broadminded, while they are inhumanly unabashed and ruthless caste-maniacs at home. Or, they try to conveniently skirt the issue altogether, saying, “I am not specialised in language to think that far. My line of study or work is different”, as if love of one’s mother tongue is rocket science. While in Andhra, the Telugus are just patriotic Indians. While on the soil of Tamilnadu, they are true blood Tamilians. While in the USA, they are proud Americans. Strangely, the Telugus are never Telugus. It is not known why our true identity as the Telugus has come to be deemed as shameful to be confessed to as a criminal background."

So how can we regain appreciation for our identity? The rough path out of this *slavish mentality* has indeed been trodden before: look at Bengalis, Tamils, Marathis, Gujaratis and other influential groups. They have something in common, and it is something that we skipped - revolution.


Bengalis had an upheaval of culture. From language, poetry to abolishing the social evils like Sati and Untouchability. Similar things were done by Marathis. They also have a legacy of promoting a backward class as the ruler class in their recent history, a cause of heavy social upward mobility, and thus establishing an empire. Tamils went from being heavily hierarchical to bringing focus on the lower classes. They even abolished caste names and surnames, and instead switched it with their fathers' names throughout the whole state.


Malayalis dominated the initial days of independent India by being an efficient and easily employed workforce, just like the Tamils, going to farther places unreachable from their homeland, such as the Gulf and Southeast Asia. They did not have a feeling of "inferiority" for working in such positions. Gujaratis are entrepreneurs; even if they are in a foreign land with quite a bare investment, they put the maximum amount of effort to grow their business.


What does this have to do with fame and recognition? Well, for starters, we are still the same as our 19th century people. Money, cities, and jobs have changed but our people, our outdated beliefs, and our archaic mentality from British India staunchly prevails, pervades, and permeates our society. Due to our slavish mentality, nobody wants to take the risk of a great leap to go somewhere unknown, to do something uncommon or to set up something unique, following the previous man's path like a sheep.


That we should not learn how to read and write Telugu in favour of English. That we should not read Telugu books, or appreciate Telugu poetry and art, and instead denigrate it as archaic in favour of the "modern" Western arts. These claims would be outrageous to any other culture on Earth - there is no superior or inferior art, as there is no inherently superior or inferior culture. However, the cunning, utilitarian-minded Telugu would happily reject anything which does not assist him in elevating his status among his peers and "opening opportunities" for himself, by becoming more "advanced" and Western. But our schools completely ignore our own unique culture, and instead spread propaganda praising our invaders who have done nil for us. We don't even appreciate our literary outputs of the 20th century; what do you expect in fame to our artists, writers, poets or any literary or historical figures? We don't even try to go against our parents or neighbours, so what do we expect to serve to society? We don't even try to go get a job that pushes us out of our comfort zone, and instead would settle for a job in the software industry or government services, the latter like 1980s India. We do not even try to advance our career once we have a job! What more can you expect to innovate or implement? Anyone who studies anything apart from medicine or engineering is destined to be a loser in our eyes, and does not deserve encouragement.


With this closed-minded and regressive psychology, what else would you expect apart from software developers, engineers, and doctors who would only do the service they are trained to do? We boast that Telugus are everywhere across the globe, that they are sophisticated international citizens, but are we doing anything differently in any of these foreign countries? No - same old apathy, ambitionlessness, unconduciveness and stagnancy. When we move abroad, we are still middle-class workers. We are slavish in every single approach. It is extremely rare to find a అభిమానం ఉన్న తెలుగువారు (self-respecting Telugu) who breaks this mold. We sing boundless praise about our Telugu or Indian CEOs, but have you wondered why we are never the founders of such companies? It is obvious: would you expect Telugus to contribute *anything* novel to society, with every social institution constantly conditioning us from childhood to be an obedient worker, and encouraging us to consume brainless media on our free time, building nothing of our characters? Sheep are indeed lost without someone to follow, and slaves are lost without someone superior to them.


Is it "broad-minded" and "smart", as most "modern" Telugus claim they are, to lack originality, to possess limited creativity and minimal awareness of their own society, with no individual excellence in the arts, history, sports, fitness, culture, nor even a fluent command in their own mother tongue, as they misappropriate English into every sentence they speak? Does that make us Telugus successful, worldly, or superior to our fellow Telugus? No - it simply proves that we are hypocritical, unfit, and unrefined simpletons, with zero knowledge, dreams or pursuits outside of what we are told to study, and what we are told to work as. And it certainly reveals our immense hubris in addition, as we think deviance from this pre-planned life is a grave mistake.


We do not care about art or literature or history or philosophy, as we are told it is useless to us. What an enigma that what the "broad-minded" slavish Telugu ironically dismisses as useless, alone is powerful enough to save him: art, literature and philosophy examine how to live a truly happy and free life, entice us to think originally, and in the least, provide us with short escapes from life that are much more immersive than any new commercialized Bollywood high-budget mass movies; pure insults to cinematography.


One is not made **స్వతంత్రుడు (आज़ादी/FREE)** by being a **బానిస (गुलाम/SLAVE)** to society's institutions, especially not institutions that systemically dismantle our innate creativeness and originality as humans, and effectively turn us into ignorant and uneducated workers who have no identity or purpose. At least a slave is versatile enough to do any task, but we are only fit to do the task that we are trained and assigned to do by our "superiors" - White people who speak with a White accent; the British, who have been gone for 75 years to date. That task is all which a "modern" Telugu knows in life: working in a templated white-collar job, stuck in the middle class with no greater aspiration than to supplant his children's creativity with the same slavish mind as himself. In that aspect, a [coolie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolie_(novel)) is freer than the "modern" Telugu.


This is not to undermine anyone who is striving hard to bring a great name to our Telugu society. This is to say that we persistently encourage one *small* margin of people who ably try to glorify us (actors, politicians, directors), and we get upset when the output of famous individuals turns out to be in numbers countable on our fingers.


Of course, people will say that "others are exceeding us," but are we actually racing to even compare ourselves with them? We have shown no signs of leaving our 19th century colonial mentality, obsessed with caste and status, which is what Britishers used to destabilize and disunify us Indians. In reality, we are living in the 21st century with basically the same society as in the 19th. Only the strugglers make their names! And I'm proud that our neighbours are doing great in this factor, sticking to whatever makes them better every day. As proud Telugus, we must employ *inspiration* from our neighbours - not seek to imitate them, losing our own precious identity in the process. Thank you.


As a side note, I credit Ramoji for his efforts in preserving Telugu culture with ETV news, the last real Telugu news station.
